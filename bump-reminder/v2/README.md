## Take Note
While a multiplier is a bonus to an already existing currency system; according to Disboard, it is considered a reward (not a bonus) and violates the TOS, I do not take responsibility if your server gets blacklisted!

## Second Bot Required
Bump Reminder is required, when setting it up, set the bump response to none, this will instead leave a reaction which YAGPDB will be able to respond on

## What programs I have

<details>
<summary>Actions</summary>

These are pretty similar to Owo Bot I suppose, it's an alternative I made so I didn't have as many bots. Instead of using owo as your prefix though, you use yag (i.e. yag hug @mention)!

<summary>Boost Messages</summary>

I noticed that many people were beginning to boost the server, and I wanted there to be more in it for them instead of just a boring boost message, so this program detects when a user boosts, and it gives a nice thank you message and gives them reputation for boosting as well as a way of saying thanks!

<summary>Bump Reminder</summary>

For much the same reason as the Actions, I wanted to reduce the number of bots, so I challenged myself to make a program that could replace bump reminder. I succeeded. It reminds between 121 and 125 minutes after the server has been bumped instead of exactly on the dot, but I'm very proud of it, it was more of a limitation and I'm happy I got so close to 2 hours despite it.

<summary>Color Roles</summary>

With the introduction of slash commands to Color-Chan, I noticed many users were getting confused, so instead of having to deal with it, I made a rolemenu that would give colors upon reacting, but not remove the role upon the reaction being removed. And then to take it a step further, I created these commands to wipe the reactions from the color menu, so members could just keep coming back without having to worry about removing their previous reaction.

<summary>Currency</summary>

I'd say currency is a fairly common thing with bots now, we had many bot in our server previously, we had Owo, we had SlotBot, we had Useless Bot, and many others, heck we still do (well not SlotBot anymore, that got annoying). Most of these currency commands were made as SlotBot's replacement, we wanted to partner with other servers, however having a bot that would always drop wallets, even in the middle of a venting channel, it disqualified us from most servers understandably, many of our users wanted SlotBot though, so we made our own version where you could control the wallet drops and even decrease or increase the chances of them dropping, and the amount you'd get from picking them up. We also have many other functions included in this command such as a daily command, a net leaderboard, a balance command, and even a way to pay others. We're still adding and hope to improve more with time, but for now, we're happy with it!

<details>
<summary>Daily</summary>

Ever had trouble getting the server to talk? Well this can be configured with a interval command, and will send a topic, a cat fact, and even some advice at your desired times, the goal of this was to increase server interaction, and it did!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Shop</summary>

We needed to do something about all the currency members we're earning. As such, we made a role shop, this role shop gives you your desired shop roles for 24 hours for whatever cost you decide, its easy to configure and make for some fun times!
</details>

<details>
<summary>SOS Event Scheduler</summary>

Play State of Survival, I know I do. With FiendBot's shutdown, we were left with few options for getting our reminders configured and handled, we had to manually remind members that trap or horde was happening which sometimes we would run late or just forget because of life. I sought to replace it, I did it! These commands can configure the times for trap and horde, they remind at 1hr, 10 minutes, and on the dot, as well as automatically schedule trap 2 days from your current trap, and horde 14 days from your current horde, making for what is hopefully less configuring for you!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Tickets</summary>

Do users use commands that much, would they go through the effort of opening a ticket via command when they can just ping a staff member for help? Perhaps not, I know users weren't really aware of ticketing in our server, it existed, but they didn't know, so I sought out to make a ticket tool where all they had to do was react to the message, and voila, a ticket was opened, was pretty simple and easy and I'm happy I did it, and so are our members!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Verify</summary>

Have a verification process members have to go through before they can talk? We do, they even get kicked within 24 hours if they don't verify, so it was important to us to make sure members got verified in a timely manner and even that they had other members to welcome them. This verification command will verify the user and ping your greetings channel so they can feel more welcomed into your server!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Help</summary>

Made modifications to the in-built help command as the server began to rely more heavily on Custom Commands, make sure to disable the help command in command overrides by setting deleteResponse to 0. Don't worry, the custom command will still send the original help command as well through an exec command! All will be good!

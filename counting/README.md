### Disclamer

I `Raspberry#5310` didn't come up with this idea, nor do I take credit for any of the code. The following parts of the code were all made a while ago but I modified them so users could challenge themselves to count higher every time they failed, and also integrated it with economy so users could earn while do so.

The file included in this directory only needs to replace the actual count detection command, this file is also on the old DB system, and will not work with the most up to date counting DB as there were too many DB calls after adding economy!
